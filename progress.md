# Project Progress

## Current State

- ✅ Image processing script (`processUploads.ts`) implemented
  - Converts images to WebP format
  - Creates optimized placeholder versions
  - Handles nested directories
  - Maintains directory structure
- ✅ Cleanup script (`cleanupOldImages.ts`) implemented
  - Removes old JPG/PNG files after WebP conversion
  - Safe deletion with WebP existence check
  - Recursive directory processing

## Next Steps

- Test both scripts with various image types and directory structures
- Consider adding error reporting or logging functionality
- Consider adding a dry-run mode for safer testing
